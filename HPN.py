A house price notification system typically works as follows:

Data Collection:

The system collects real estate data from various sources. This data may include property listings, their details, and most importantly, the price of the houses.
Data Processing:

The collected data is processed to extract relevant information. This involves parsing web pages, extracting price data, and cleaning the information for consistency.
Price Monitoring:

The system regularly checks for updates in house prices. This can be done at set intervals or triggered by specific events like new listings or changes in existing listings.
Price Comparison:

The system compares the current prices with historical data to identify any changes or trends in house prices.
Notification:

When a significant change in price occurs (e.g., a price drop or a new listing), the system triggers a notification. Notifications can be sent through various channels like email, SMS, or push notifications on a mobile app.
User Preferences:

Users may set their preferences, such as the type of houses they are interested in, their budget, and preferred locations. The system filters the data based on these preferences to provide more relevant notifications.
Alerts and Updates:

Users receive alerts and updates based on their preferences, allowing them to stay informed about changes in house prices that match their criteria.
Overall, a house price notification system automates the process of tracking real estate market changes and keeps users informed about properties that meet their criteria, potentially helping them make informed decisions when buying or selling a house.
